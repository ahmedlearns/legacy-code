# Notes

slides branches example: `slides/1` or `slides/what-is-legacy-code`

demo code under `src/` branches: `demo/1.0`, `demo/1.1`, `demo/2.0`, etc

# What is Legacy Code?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1r2x3C6.jpg" width="250"/>

--

Code we've gotten from someone else

--

Code that hasn't been touched in living memory

--

Code you're afraid to touch


--

Code written by someone who is no longer around

--

Code without tests

???
No matter how well written it is, pretty, objected-oriented, or well encapsulated it is. Without tests, we can't change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. We can't be certain within a reasonable timeframe if our code is getting better or worse.

# Changing Software

## Questions to ask yourself:

<br />

--

1. .left[What changes do we have to make?]

--

2. .left[How will we know that we've done them correctly?]

--

3. .left[How will we know that we haven't broken anything?]

--

4. .left[How much change can you afford if changes are risky?]

# "If it's not broke, don't fix it."

???
It's tempting to think that we can minimize software problems and bugs by avoiding them, but, unfortunately, it always catches up with us.

Avoiding creating new classes and methods leads to giganto-hard-to-understand-and-modify systems.
