I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in any of the things you are about to see in this presentation.

(I feel that we're all picking it up as we move along)

These are techniques I've picked up from reading some books and learning from others,

including some of you listening in right now.

* in the process of learning more about these techniques
* figured I'd share it with you all
* if you have any input or ideas on any of the slides, let's talk about it.
* I'd be lieing if I said working on Aveanna's codebases didn't have anything to do with this interest :)

# What is Legacy Code?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1r2x3C6.jpg" width="250"/>

???
Any ideas?

Without tests, no matter how well written it is, pretty, objected-oriented, or well encapsulated it is,

we can't change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. We can't be certain within a reasonable timeframe if our code is getting better or worse.

--

Code we've gotten from someone else

--

Code that hasn't been touched in living memory

--

Code you're afraid to touch


--

Code written by someone who is no longer around

--

Code without tests

# Changing Software

## Questions to ask yourself:

<br />

--

1. .left[What changes do we have to make?]

--

2. .left[How will we know that we've done them correctly?]

--

3. .left[How will we know that we haven't broken anything?]

--

4. .left[How much change can you afford if changes are risky?]

# "If it's not broke, don't fix it."

???
It's tempting to think that we can minimize software problems and bugs by avoiding them, but, unfortunately, it always catches up with us.

Avoiding creating new classes and methods leads to giganto-hard-to-understand-and-modify systems.

# Sunk Cost Fallacy

???
When you continue a behavior as a result of the previously invested time, money, or effort.

Examples:

Over-eating to get your money's worth when you order too much food.

Driving through a blizzard to get to a concert you paid $20 for.

"If the costs outweigh the benefits, the extra costs incurred (inconvenience, time or even money) are held in a different mental account than the one associated with the original work, transaction, etc."

I included this slide because I feel that this is a very common fallacy to fall into, but can have huge ramifications when applied to software.

I definitely fall pray to it myself, but it's good to be knowledgable of its existence.

# The Legacy Code Dilemma

When we change code, we should have tests in place.

To put tests in place, we often have to change code.

--

What do we do?

Ehh. Be careful. Use your refactoring tools.

# What else can we do?

<br>

???
Any ideas?

A broad test that covers a large swath of the application will help you notice if any of your changes break something.

Since you have finite time to spend writing tests, it is more important to get broad coverage than targeted coverage.

<br>

Usually TDD writes just enough test code to make the tests fail;

then you write the model code (or business logic) only until all tests pass.

When working with legacy code, the business logic is mostly already written.

It's sometimes necessary to write a lot of tests before switching back to business logic.

--

Focus more on broad coverage than targeted coverage.

--

Write a lot of tests before you can write a little.

--

Already have some manual tests? Can they be automated?

--

Already have some functional/acceptance/integration tests? <br>
Can they be morphed into unit tests?

If it's all about the tests, there's a big problem.

--

= how do we break dependencies?

class: center

# Breaking Dependencies

<img src="https://live.mrf.io/statics/i/ps/lrmonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Motherboy.jpg" width="450">

???

Dependencies can be problematic, but, fortunately we can break them.

---

# I Can't Get This Class into a Test Harness

???
Test Harness: enabler that does the work of executing tests via a test library, and also generates an output (e.g. a report).

This includes your test data and your test scenarios.

Essentially, you have a complete test harness when I can click a button or run a command to execute all of your tests and generate a report.

--

## Bringing a dependency into a test is hard because:

--

Objects can't be instantiated easily.

--

The test refuses to build with the class in it.

--

The constructor we need to use does some wonky stuff.

--

The tests cannot currently *sense* what's happening in the 50-line constructor.

---

# The Case of the Irritating Parameter

--

```
public class CreditValidator {

  public CreditValidator(ReporterConnection connection,
                        CreditMaster master,
                        String validatorId) {
    ...
  }

  ValidationCertificate validateCustomer(Customer customer)
      throws InvalidCreditException {
    ...
  }
}
```

--

The Mission:

* Add a method, `getValidationPercent`, to tell us the percentage of `validateCustomer` calls we've made over the life of a `CreditValidator`.

???
What's step 1?

--

Step 1: Write a test.


--

...

--

How do we get started?

???
But how are we going to bring a CreditValidator into a test with all of it's dependencies

---

## Just Try It

--

Best way to see if you can instantiate a class in a test is to just try to do it.

--

<br>
```
public void testCanCreateValidator() {
  CreditValidator validator = new CreditValidator();
}
```
<br>

--

The compiler will do part of the work for you by telling you want you need to make it work.

???
Construction tests look a little weird. They don't have an assertion.

Later on, when the object can be instantiated, the test can be repurposed to do something more meaningful.

---

## Digging Deeper

--

```
public class ReporterConnection {

  public ReporterConnection(int port, String username, String password)
      throws IOException {
    ...
  }
}
```

???
When a connection is constructed, it connects with a server. It uses that connection to then retrieve reports needed to validate a customer's credit.

--

```
public class CreditMaster {

  public CreditMaster(String filename, boolean isLocal) {
    ...
  }
}

```

???

When a connection is constructed, it connects with a server. It uses that connection to then retrieve reports needed to validate a customer's credit.

CreditMaster gives us policy info that we can use in some credit decisions. It can load info from a spreadsheet and holds it in memory for us.

---

## So we just create these objects, right?

```
public void testCanCreateValidator() {
  ReporterConnection connection =
    new ReporterConnection(DEFAULT_PORT, "admin", "m4d$ki11s");

  CreditMaster master = new CreditMaster("customers.csv", true);

  CreditValidator validator =
    new CreditValidator(connection, master, "a1234");
}

```

--

<br>
What's wrong with this picture?

???

Creating a connection to a server is not a good idea. Why?

Unit tests only tests the system under test (the constructor).

Besides, it can take too long to get a connection, and the server may not always be available.

---

## What can we do instead?

--

There are many ways to go about this.

--

Mocking, stubbing, etc. are the obvious ways that come to mind.

--

...but be careful with mocking.

---

## On Mocking

--

The Scenario: we want to write a unit test.

--

That is, a function that tests a single codepath through a single method.

--

You will need to mock every dependency that your unit test touches.

--

Though that may sound good, if you're not careful, you'll spend all your time mocking dependencies.

--

Which can in turn unintentionally make your tests more complicated and probably even fragile.

--

In summary, unit tests should test a cohesive unit, which can be more than a single method, IMHO

---

## What about the whole focus on breaking dependencies?

--

## I don't have a real answer for you other than, software is complicated 🤷‍♂️

???
Mock objects are good when you want to test interactions, e.g. funcation a() was called exactly one time.

This can become problematic when you end up testing interactions even when not necessary (I am guilty of this).

---

## A Mocking Example

--

Overusing mocks to test interactions can lead to testing implementation (bad).

--

We really want to test that we have the intended result (most of the time).

--

Testing the result:
```
testTheThingIsSorted() {
  var list = [5, 3, 2, 9]
  sort(list)

  assert([2, 3, 5, 9], list)
}
```

--

Testing the implementation:
```
testTheThingIsSorted() {
  var list = [5, 3, 2, 9]
  sort(list)

  assert.that(compare(5,3)).was.called.once();
  assert.that(compare(5,2)).was.called.once();
  assert.that(compare(5,9)).was.called.once();
  ...
}
```

???
If and when the implementation of `sort()` is changed, the first test still does it's job.

---

## Are mocks the same as stubs?

--

If you ask such people like Martin Fowler, his answer is a [resounding no](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html).

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GbjPKuS.png" width="550">
</p>

???
I'm sure we can sit here and talk about when and where to use mock objects, but let's get back to it.

---

## Back to the program

--

Mocking libraries usually allow creating objects to be used as *dummy objects*.

???
Dummy objects: are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists like in this example.

--

<br>
```
public void testCanCreateValidator() {
  ReporterConnection connection = mock(ReporterConnection.class);

  CreditMaster master = mock(CreditMaster.class);

  CreditValidator validator =
    new CreditValidator(connection, master, "a1234");
}

```

--

<br>
Compiler should be happy now, so we should be good to start additional testing.

--

If it felt like using a mock is overkill here, that's because it likely is.

---

## Extract Interface

--

With this method, let's create a *fake object* by creating an interface first.

--

<br>
```
public interface IReporterConnection {
  connect()
  disconnect()
  Report createReport(int customerId)
}
```

--

```
public class FakeConnection implements IReporterConnection {
  public Report report;
  public void connect() {}
  public void disconnect() {}
  public Report createReport(int customerId) {}
}
```

???

Mock objects are overkill in this case - we don't need to test the interaction of a validator and a connection right now.

---

## Let's Fake It 'till We Make It

--

```
public void testCanValidateCustomer() {
  FakeConnection connection = new FakeConnection();

  CreditMaster master = new CreditMaster("customers.csv", true);

  CreditValidator validator =
    new CreditValidator(connection, master, "a1234");

  Certificate result = validator.validateCustomer(...);

  assertEquals(Certificate.VALID, result.getStatus());
}
```

---

## Pass the Null

--

When you are writing tests and an object has a tough dependency to construct, *consider passing null instead*.

--

If the parameter is in use, rely on an exception being thrown to tell you where.

--

You can decide at that point whether you really need that parameter.

--

<br>
```
public void testCanCreateTheThing() {
  CreditValidator validator = new CreditValidator(null, null, "abc1234");
}
```

--

<br>
**Remember**: This is a test. Unless you know what you're doing, don't do this in production code.

---

# The Case of the Hidden Dependency

--

```
public class NurseScheduler {
  public NurseScheduler() {
    Scheduler scheduler = new Scheduler();

    int nurseType = 17;

    scheduler.doSomethingProbablyNotIdempotent();

    if (scheduler.getStatus() == AVAILABLE) {
      scheduler.register(this, nurseType);
    } else
      scheduler.iAmTooCoolForCurlyBraces();
  }
}
```

--

<br>
Let's get this in a test

--

What's wrong with this picture?

--

Also, what does `17` even mean?

---

## Parameterize the Constructor

--

```
public NurseScheduler(Scheduler scheduler) {
  int nurseType = 17;

  scheduler.doSomethingProbablyNotIdempotent();

  if (scheduler.getStatus() == AVAILABLE) {
    scheduler.register(this, nurseType);
  } else
    scheduler.iAmTooCoolForCurlyBraces();
}
```

--

This may not seem like much of an improvement, but it gives us more leverage.

--

We can now create a ~~mock~~ dummy object, or a fake object using the *Extract Interface* technique.

---

## What if we need to preserve the signature?

--

Sometimes, there is too much risk and/or negative consequences to changing a constructor or method signature.

--

If you're in a language that allows it, **overload the constructors**. If you're not, create a new method.

--

```
public NurseScheduler() {
  init(new Scheduler());
}

public init(Scheduler scheduler) {
  int nurseType = 17;

  scheduler.doSomethingProbablyNotIdempotent();

  if (scheduler.getStatus() == AVAILABLE) {
    scheduler.register(this, nurseType);
  } else
    scheduler.iAmTooCoolForCurlyBraces();
}

```

???
There are many ways to get passed this.

Override a getter? Override a factory method?

Feel free to get creative.

---

# I Can't Run This Method in a Test Harness

???
Test Harness: enabler that does the work of executing tests via a test library, and also generates an output (e.g. a report).

This includes your test data and your test scenarios.

Essentially, you have a complete test harness when I can click a button or run a command to execute all of your tests and generate a report.

--

### Instantiating a class is often only the first part of the battle.

--

### Part two involves writing tests for the methods that need to be changed.

--

### That can be hard too, because:

--

The method might not be accessible to the test - it could be private or have some other accessibility issue.

--

It might be difficult to construct the parameter dependencies of the method.

--

The method might have have hidden dependencies and/or bad side effects.

???
======= <br>
It could be modifying a database, connecting to a server, launching a rocket, etc.

---

## The Case of the Private Method

--

How do we write a test for a private method?

--

It's simple - you make it public.

--

If that bothered you just then, it might mean that your method is doing too much.

---

## Why would making a private method public bother us?

--

Here are some possible reasons:

--

1. It's just a utility method. It's not something that a client of the class would care about.

--

2. The class is used by clients that could be adversely affected by the use of this method.

???
It may affect the results from other methods in the class.

--

The first reason isn't the end of the world. If making it public still bothers you, try to figure out whether it would be better to refactor the method to another class.

--

The second reason can be more serious. It's time to move the private method to a new internal-only class where it can be public.

--

That makes the methods testable and the design better.

--

I know that sounds a little harsh, but it's worth it Remember, good design is test-*able*.

---

## What if that much refactoring is too risky?

--

```
public class Wheel {
  public void spin() { ... }

  public void setSportModeSetting() { ... }

  private void adjustSuspension(int dx, int dy) { ... }
}

```
???
Let's say there aren't many tests in place and we are forced to be more careful before we can start to break down the class.

This is a bit of an exaggerated example, but it will still show the point.

--

You're probably wondering why the wheel class is adjusting the suspension.

--

This is legacy code, remember? :)

--

`setSportModeSetting` calls a hardware APIs around the car to adjust the type of "Sport" Mode selected by the driver.

--

It's result also depends on different environmental factors like the motion of the car.

--

In the process, `setSportModeSetting` may make repeated calls to `adjustSuspension`

--

Unfortunately, a few of the API's used by `setSportModeSetting` have changed, and we need to make a change to `adjustSuspension`.

---

## Can we just make it public?

--

That can have some very negative consequences.

--

`Wheel` also holds on to variables that capture the state of the suspension.

--

If `adjustSuspension` is called outside of `setSportModeSetting`, it could cause some trouble with the suspension changing unexpectedly at high speeds.

---

## Before we move further

--

How did we get into this mess?

--

This class has too many responsibilities.

--

What we should do is refactor.

--

But our hands our tied since we need to be careful with refactoring right now.

???
Why? Could be a number of reasons.

Could be a bad time in the release cycle.

Or you might not have enough time before a certain deadline.

Or there is just too much risk to the existing behavior.

---

## Here's one way to go about it.

--

Let's only *slightly* violate encapsulation.

```
public class Wheel {
  public void setSportModeSetting() { ... }

  protected void adjustSuspension(int dx, int dy) { ... }
}

```

--

Then subclass `Wheel`:

```
public class TestWheel extends Wheel {
  void adjustSuspension(int dx, int dy) {
    ...
    super.adjustSuspension(dx, dy);
  }
}

```

--

Now we can call `adjustSuspension` in a test, albeit indirectly.

--

I know, I know. The point was to not make the method public. We're making it `protected` to make it more accessible.

---

## Ehh.

--

At least it's in a test, which is a fair trade, in my opinion.

--

We do have to reason for the future that `adjustSuspension` can be called in subclasses.

--

But the whole point was to get this method in a test. Once we feel covered enough, we can separate the `Wheel` methods into different classes and make them testable like we originally wanted.
